# RERAN Module Roadmap

A survey of all eight user groups against the source material: what exists, what is documented, what is missing, and in what order to build it.

**Scope:** post-login functionality only. Registration and onboarding are excluded from this project.

Services that the source material does not contain but the PRD or Nigerian law appears to require are catalogued separately in [proposed-services.md](proposed-services.md). This roadmap covers only the sourced 145.

## The Landscape

| Group | Module | Services | Roles | Sub-systems | Documentation status |
| :---- | :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---- |
| **A** | Regulatory Authority & Governance | **0** | 8 | 6 | Not started — see gap below |
| **B** | Real Estate Developers | 27 | 4 | 3 | UI complete (19 screens); no service flows |
| **C** | Financial & Trust Institutions | 18 | 4 | 3 | 18 service-flow files written, 16 of them thin; no UI |
| **D** | Real Estate Service Companies | 26 | 4 | 4 | Roles, services overview; no service flows |
| **E+F** | Individual User | 41 | 6 | 4 | 43 service flows written; count reconciled; no UI |
| **G** | Allied Professionals & Service Trustees | **0** | 4 | 3 | Roles documented; interfaces not written — see note below |
| **H** | Public & Informational Users | 33 | 2 | 2 | Roles, services overview; no service flows |
| | **Total** | **145** | **28** | | |

Service counts are verified row by row against the master service table and reconcile exactly with the source workbook's own summary. The individual-user module's count now reconciles too — see Known Issues for how.

**Pattern worth naming:** every module that has moved past roles/overview has done so unevenly. Group B has full UI and no service flows. Individual User has full service flows and no UI. Group C now has a file per service but little inside them. No module has both stages complete yet.

---

## The Group A Gap

**Group A owns zero services, yet appears as approver on nearly every one of the other 145.**

The user group structure gives Group A eight roles and six platform sub-systems:

* Admin & Configuration Console
* Licensing & Registry Engine
* Escrow / Trust-Account Audit System
* Inspection & Enforcement Module
* Tribunal & Remote-Litigation System
* Revenue & Settlement Dashboard

The PRD independently specifies three feature modules covering the same ground: staff workflow and case management, reporting and analytics, and administration/security/audit.

So the regulator's own system is described at capability level in two source documents, but has no entries at all in the service table — because the service table catalogues services *offered to external users*, not the internal work of processing them.

**Why this matters:** every one of the 145 external services terminates in a Group A action. The Compliance & Escrow Auditor alone is the approver for all 18 Group C services and most of Group B's. Without Group A documented, no external service flow can describe what happens after submission, and the back-office is the largest unspecified area of the platform.

> **Proposed** — Group A should be documented as a module organised by sub-system rather than by service, since it has no service catalogue. The six sub-systems above become the module's top-level structure, with each documenting the queues, decisions, and actions available to the roles that operate it. Needs client confirmation.

### Estimated shape

| Sub-system | Primary roles | Feeds from |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Licensing & Registry Engine | Licensing & Registration Officer | B, D licensing services |
| Escrow / Trust-Account Audit | Compliance & Escrow Auditor | B escrow services, C approvals |
| Transaction Audit Queue | Compliance & Escrow Auditor | C transaction services, E title services |
| Tribunal & Remote-Litigation | Dispute Adjudication Officer | D, F dispute services |
| Inspection & Enforcement | Inspection & Enforcement Officer | B construction filings |
| Revenue & Settlement | Revenue & Finance Officer | All fee-bearing services |
| Admin & Configuration | System Super Administrator | Platform-wide |

The Inspection & Enforcement Officer is the emptiest role in the project: a named sub-system, an enforcement mandate in the PRD, and not one service anywhere in the source that produces an inspection, a stop-work notice, or a penalty. See `proposed-services.md` P-30 to P-32.

## The Group G Note

Group G also owns zero services, but for a different and less concerning reason.

Survey Companies, Valuers, Conveyancers and Registration Trustee Centres appear constantly *inside* other groups' workflows — "developer designates an accredited survey company", "visit Real Estate Registration Trustee Centres", "survey company prepares data and matches it to approved plans". They are participants in other groups' services rather than applicants with their own catalogue.

The Trustee Centre is the most heavily used: it is a named channel on a large share of the 145 services, acting on behalf of walk-in customers.

Roles are now documented (`modules/allied-professionals/roles-and-responsibilities.md`), but the interfaces themselves are not yet written.

> **Proposed** — Group G may not need a service catalogue at all, but does need documented interfaces for the actions it performs inside other groups' flows: survey data submission, valuation filing, and Trustee Centre operator transactions. Whether this is a module or a set of shared interface documents is an open question. Needs client confirmation.

## Module Profiles

### Group B — Real Estate Developers (27 services)

The most heavily regulated external group, and the only one with UI documented before service flows — the reverse of the project's derivation chain.

| Source category | Services |
| :---- | :---: |
| Real Estate Development Services | 21 |
| Real Estate Licensing Service | 2 |
| Title Deed Data Services | 4 |

Escrow dominates: account activation, transfer, profit withdrawal, payment release, mortgage deposit, bank guarantee cancellation, expense cap amendment. Every one of these routes through a Group C Account Trustee, making B and C tightly coupled.

**Status:** all 19 screens migrated to `modules/real-estate-developer/ui/screens/`, shared component/validation/status-badge docs consolidated, source UI file retired. No service-flow documents exist yet — the UI describes screens with nothing underneath specifying the business rules they implement.

### Group D — Real Estate Service Companies (26 services)

Four distinct sub-domains under one group — the most internally varied module.

| Source category | Services |
| :---- | :---: |
| Jointly Owned Property Services | 11 |
| Real Estate Licensing Services | 8 |
| Real Estate Rental Services | 3 |
| Real Estate Transaction Services | 2 |
| Real Estate Dispute Services | 2 |

Jointly-owned property is effectively its own product: owners' associations, service-charge budgets, escrow accounts for joint properties, appointing auditors. Several JOP services mirror Group B's escrow services with different actors.

**Status:** roles and services overview documented. No individual service-flow documents written yet.

### Group H — Public & Informational (33 services)

Highest service count, lowest complexity. Almost every service follows the same three-step shape: log in, select service, view information. No approver, no fee in most cases, no application lifecycle.

The exceptions worth noting: Fee Payment Receipt, Fee Refund Request (seven business days, Ministry of Finance approval), and Track Your Case — these have real workflows. The other 30 are lookups.

**Assessment:** cheapest module per service by a wide margin. A single well-designed lookup pattern covers most of it.

**Status:** roles and services overview documented. No service-flow documents written yet — the proposed single parameterised flow plus catalogue table is still just a proposal.

### Group E+F — Individual User (41 sourced services, 43 documented)

Service flows complete: 43 files under `modules/individual-user/service-flows/`.  Roles, services overview, and shared platform features also documented.

The 41-to-43 relationship reconciles: ten tenant-dispute source rows are legitimately consolidated into one service, thirty-two services trace directly to source rows, and eleven are extrapolated from role descriptions rather than explicit rows. The `source_type` frontmatter field (`sourced` / `extrapolated`) records which is which.

**Status:** the most complete module on the service-flow side, and the only one with zero UI work — no `ui/` folder exists for this module at all.

### Group C — Financial & Trust Institutions (18 services)

Roles, services overview, and a payments document are complete. 23 open questions sent to the client are recorded in `modules/financial-trust-institutions/open-questions.md`.

**Status:** all 18 service-flow files now exist under `service-flows/`, but only Service #1 has substantive depth. The other seventeen average around 1 KB and record workflow, documents, fees, channel, output and SLA as "not specified in the available source material."

That characterisation is wrong for most of them. Rows 28–45 of the master service table carry a workflow sequence, channel, issued document and SLA for every one of the 18. Mortgage registration (row 30) alone specifies the four-step bank-to-department sequence, both channels, five possible output documents and a 20–25 minute SLA — none of which reached `service-03-mortgage-registration.md`.

The genuine open questions — fee settlement model, status vocabulary, the Service #1/#2 role inconsistency — remain genuinely open. But they are a smaller set than the current files imply. See Known Issues.

### Group G — Allied Professionals & Service Trustees (0 services)

Roles documented. See "The Group G Note" above for why this module has no service catalogue and what it needs instead.

**Status:** interfaces not yet written.

## Proposed Sequence

> **Proposed** — sequencing is our recommendation, not a client requirement. Needs confirmation.

**1. Group C flow backfill.** Smallest job on the list and it corrects a live inaccuracy: eighteen files currently assert the source is silent where it is not. Backfilling from rows 28–45 costs little and removes a misleading artefact from the repo.

**2. Group A.** Everything else terminates here, and its absence blocks every other module's flows from describing what happens after submission. Also the largest unknown, so learning its shape early de-risks the rest.

**3. Group B service flows.** UI already exists; writing the flows underneath completes the module and corrects the inverted derivation chain. Also unblocks the B↔C escrow coupling.

**4. Individual User UI.** The mirror image of #3 — flows exist, screens don't. Closing this and #3 leaves the project with two fully round-tripped modules (source → flows → UI) to use as the house style for everything after.

**5. Group H.** Cheap, high volume, mostly one repeated pattern. Good candidate for batch work once the patterns from A and B are established.

**6. Group D.** Largest remaining unknown after A, and the JOP sub-domain may warrant splitting.

**7. Group G interfaces.** Once the flows that reference survey companies and Trustee Centres exist, their interfaces can be derived from actual usage rather than guessed.

The proposed-services list runs alongside this sequence rather than inside it: it needs a client decision before any of it becomes documentation work.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Module | Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 17 of 18 service flows are thin stubs that record source-available data as unspecified | Financial & Trust | Open — backfill from master table rows 28–45 |
| UI documented before service flows | Real Estate Developer | Open — flows to be written underneath |
| No UI documented at all | Individual User | Open — the mirror-image gap of Real Estate Developer's |
| 23 client questions outstanding | Financial & Trust | Sent, awaiting answers |
| No application status vocabulary exists platform-wide | All | Proposed for Group C; needs a platform decision |
| Root `KnowledgeBase/README.md` lists seven projects; only RERAN is active | Project | Open |
| `RERAN/README.md` has four stub sections ("Modules", "Tech Stack", "Stakeholders", "Entry Points" all say "To be completed") despite this roadmap holding most of that detail already | Project | Open |
| The service catalogue carries instruments from its source jurisdiction that have no Nigerian equivalent (usufruct, Taqeemi certificate) while omitting ones that are mandatory here (Governor's Consent, C-of-O) | Project | Open — see proposed-services.md |

**Resolved since this roadmap was first written:** the 43 individual-user service/feature docs have been moved into `service-flows/`; the 295 KB Group B UI source file has been fully split into 19 screen files plus consolidated component/validation/status-badge docs and retired; the individual-user 39-vs-41 count discrepancy has been audited and closed, with four genuinely undocumented services added and a `source_type` field introduced to distinguish sourced from extrapolated services; all 18 Group C service-flow files created.

## Cross-Cutting Observations

**Escrow is the platform's spine.** It appears in Group B (developer drawdowns), Group C (trustee certification, auditor review), Group D (jointly-owned property accounts), and Group A (compliance audit). Four groups, one mechanism. It is the strongest candidate for a shared reference document rather than four independent descriptions.

**The Trustee Centre channel is pervasive.** A large share of services across E, F and C list Real Estate Registration Trustee Centres as a channel, sometimes as the only channel. Whether those services gain online equivalents is a scope decision that affects several modules at once.

**Every fee-bearing service pays after audit approval, not at submission.** This is stated once, in the pipeline definition, and has consequences for every module's screens and statuses. It belongs in a platform-level document, not repeated per module.

**Three groups share the same four application-management features.** Submit, Track, Respond to Information Request, Resubmit. Documented for Individual User, proposed for Group C, and certainly needed by B and D. These should be defined once at platform level.

**The service catalogue and the PRD were written from different starting points.** The catalogue is a mature, operational service list ported from another jurisdiction's land department; the PRD is written for Nigeria from first principles. They agree on registration, licensing and payments, and diverge sharply on complaints, enforcement and title instruments. Reconciling the two is the substance of `proposed-services.md`.
